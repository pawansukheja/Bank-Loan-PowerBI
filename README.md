Recommendations to Improve Loan Approval Rates and Reduce Bad Loans:

â€¢	Enhance Credit History Assessment:
o	Implement more rigorous credit history checks to identify high-risk applicants.
o	Offer credit-building products to potential borrowers with poor credit histories.

â€¢	Tailor Loan Products to Income Levels:
o	Design loan products targeting different income segments to ensure affordability and reduce default rates.
o	Provide financial education programs to help lower-income applicants manage their finances better.

â€¢	Adjust Loan Amounts and Terms:
o	Introduce stricter criteria for higher loan amounts to minimize risk.
o	Promote shorter loan terms (e.g., 36 months) which have shown better repayment rates.

â€¢	Strengthen Application Review Processes:
o	Use advanced analytics and machine learning models to identify patterns in good and bad loans.
o	Continuously improve the loan approval algorithms based on new data and insights.

By implementing these strategies, we can enhance our loan approval processes, reduce the occurrence of bad loans, and better serve our customers. Let's drive these improvements forwardðŸ’¼ðŸ’¡ðŸ“ˆ
